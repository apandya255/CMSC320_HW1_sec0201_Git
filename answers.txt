Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: It is important to use git in the educational setting as it lays the framework for how industries utilize the service for efficient communication of code. I have worked in the Financial Technology industry for DTCC and we use this service all the time for group tasks so we can work on our own branches and push to a collaborative branch once a design idea is fully executed
